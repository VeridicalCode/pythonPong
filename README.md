# PyPong

## What Is This Thing?
This is a Python verson of the classic arcade game Pong. It's based mostly on a demo project taught by freeCodeCamp.org, with some modifications for a slightly more unique experience.

## Why is it Special?
While the demo covers only basic movement, always launching the ball in a predictable trajectory, this version creates a more random experience that demands more skill from the user, utilizing an extra library and its additional functions. When feature-complete, it will also include a difficulty prompt, allowing the user to set the speed of the ball to adjust for faster or slower processing speed and user taste.

## How Do I Use It?
You'll need a Python installation. Run the file and the game will automatically launch. The left-hand paddle can be moved up and down with the W and S keys, while the right-hand paddle is moved with the Up and Down arrow keys.

## Who Made It?
Mars Getsoian

## Any Known Bugs?
Not a bug, but a known limitation of the interface: both paddles cannot be moved simultaneously.
